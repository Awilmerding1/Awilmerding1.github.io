One of my favorite places in the world is Keene Valley, New York, a small town within the Adirondack State Park.  My family has been hiking the Adirondack Mountains for nearly 100 years.  Although there are countless hikes to do and mountains to climb, many people, including myself, set the goal of becoming a "46er" which requires that one hikes all of the 46 peaks that are above 4000 feet.  Inspired by an upcoming visit to the Adirondack's, I chose to create a 46er tracker for my Sinatra Portfolio Project.

If it wasn't already obvious, yes, I will be using the clichéd representation of my coding journey as a hike.  To make the comparison a *bit* more original, I am equating my Sinatra Portfolio Project process to summiting all 46 hikes, instead of just one. 

Big Picture: I have 46 mountains to climb. So where do I begin?

As I learned from my CLI Gem Project, I needed to start with some organization.  I figured out my models and their relationships fairly quickly.  In my mind, I wanted to focus on the controller and views for one model at a time, but I soon found myself jumping around because of the ways the models relate to one another.  My ideal hiking plan is to get the worst hikes over with first, but I soon realized that this was not entirely sustainable.  If I only have a few hours should I opt to do no hike instead of go on one that I was hoping to save for the end?  If a group of friends or family are doing a hike that I wanted to save, should I stay home because I had planned to do that hike toward the of my 46er journey? If I am working on a controller action in the UsersController that pushes me into the HikesController should I refuse to follow the natural flow of the code?  Having a plan is a good thing, but refusing to be flexible with that plan can delay the desired outcome.  

At one point after I had completed a significant portion of my application, I became unsure about whether the relationship that I had chosen between Hikes and Mountains had been the correct choice.  I spent over an hour looking back at previous lessons, reviewing my notes and searching google.  I ultimately decided that my original choice of relationship had been correct.  There are many hikes that are shorter, easier and even have a better view than some of the 46ers.  If I go on one of these hikes am I wasting my time?  Is it pointless to any hikes that do not contribute to my ultimate goal?  Should I even bother to spend time deepening my understanding of my code even though it does not affect what I have written?  Additional effort, even if it has no impact on the current goal, is NEVER a bad thing and helps to build a stronger foundation for all future endeavors. 

After many days filled with ups and downs, I feel ready to submit my application.  I have everything working as I hoped it would and I have completed all the project requirements.  There is no rule against hiking a peak more than once.  If I become a 46er, will I not hike any of those mountains again? Just because I have created a functioning application, should I never go back to make changes to it?  An accomplished goal does not mean the end of the journey.  Instead, it provides an opportunity to go back and improve what you have already done.  If I learn something new that would improve my code, why not go back and implement it into my application?  If i have the opportunity to hike a mountain again under better circumstances than before, why not make a new memory?

The hiking cliché is a cliché for a reason: all journeys have their peaks and valleys, their unique challenges and moments of satisfaction.  Whether I am hiking or coding I try to remind myself that no matter how hard it is to find, there is always a solution to the problem, an end to the journey.
