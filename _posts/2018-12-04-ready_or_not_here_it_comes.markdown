I have a lot on my mind as I wrap up my final project.  Ultimately, all these thoughts come down to one concern: Am I ready? Am I ready to begin a career as a computer programmer? Am I ready to start interviewing? Am I even ready to start *practice* interviewing?!

Although I cannot stop myself from feeling nervous about my next steps, I have been able to temper these fears through retrospection.  I have been in a similar situation before. When I graduated from college in 2016 I was terrified to enter the workforce.  Aside from summer positions I had never worked 40+ hour weeks.  To make matters worse, I had only narrowed down my job search to "something in the environmental sector".  No wonder I was scared.  I had every reason to be!

This time I am *re-entering* the workforce. This time I have already experienced 40+ hour weeks.  I am keeping my options open as far as the companies in which I am interested, but this time I know that I want to be a web developer.  I keep reminding myself that although I am not new to the job search or the working world, I *am* new to the web developer job search and the web developer working world.  This both comforts me and brings back the fear.  On the one hand, I feel comforted by the fact that I have no expectations or preconceptions about the journey on which I am about to embark.  I feel comforted to that I have the opportunity to start fresh doing something that I love. On the other hand, the fear that I am not ready comes rushing back.  Do I really know enough to be an asset to a company? How can I possibly bring any value?  Again, I look back on my experiences to help minimize these worries.

Ten months ago I had never read or written a single line of code.  Now I am about to complete the Full Stack Web Development course.  Do I still have a lot to learn? Of course! Do I need to know everything before I start interviewing? Of course not!  We are never finished learning.  Throughout the course I found certain lessons more challenging than others.  I had to do some extra reading and practice to make sure that I understood the concepts that were being taught.  I might not know the answer to an interview question.  I may have no idea what I am being asked.  What I do know is that I am a capable learner. I can, and will, take the necessary steps to understand whatever it is that I need to understand to become a valuable asset to a team. 

Even after all this self-reflection I still can't get rid of the butterflies in my stomach.  Despite my nerves, I know that I am ready to move forward.  I have loved my time at Flatiron School but it is time to step out of my comfort zone and start the next chapter.  Ready or not, Here I come!
