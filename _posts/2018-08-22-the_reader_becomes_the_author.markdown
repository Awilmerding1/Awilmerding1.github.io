Growing up with parents who implemented a no-tv rule seemed like a cruel and unusual punishment at the time.  Aside from going to a friend's house, I was only allowed to watch tv on sick days and at Christmas time when a few holiday movies were permitted.  This meant that I spent a lot of time playing with toys, playing games with my siblings, and reading.  What I didn't realize at the time is that I was constantly using my imagination, formulating unique thoughts and ideas that would not have been produced by watching tv.  Thanks, Mom and Dad!

Despite my powerful imagination, I am typically a very rational thinker and I have never considered myself to be creative. To me, people who were "creative" were talented in either performing or visual arts.  However, the Oxford Dictionary defines creative as "relating to or involving the use of the imagination or original ideas to create something".  If this is the case, maybe I *am* creative after all!  Whenever I played with toys and every time I read a book I "create" an entire new world in my head.  Until I began coding, most of my "creations" were limited to my imagination.  But now, I get to take my ideas and create something that is not only real, but something that may actually serve a purpose.

There were plenty of coding-related challenges that I faced when creating my application, but the biggest stuggle for me was convincing myself that it was ready for submittal.  I had to keep telling myself that this is my first rails application and that I should not, and could not, work on it forever.  At times, my imagination got the best of me and I had to remind myself that there are still things that I have yet to learn and I will never learn them if I do not submit my project!  Whenever my application was not working as it should, I knew that there was a valid explanation and that I could solve the problem.  The real trouble comes when the application is fully functioning.  Is my application good enough? Do I need to add or change anything? How do I know when I am finished?

As a reader, although I may not want it to, a book always comes to an end.  Yes, I can reread it but there is nothing that I can do to change what the author wrote.  As I worked through this project, I realized that coding is not like reading a book, but it is like writing a book. *I* am the author and I *can* control my application.  And even better applications, unlike books, do not have an "end" and are always being updated and improved.  I do not need to finish the never-ending book that is my application - I just need to finish the chapter.
