Now 4 months into my Flatiron School journey, I have been perfecting my answers to the questions like "What are you learning?", "What will you do when you have completed the course?", "Can you give me an example of something that you have made?".  After giving many confusing and incomplete responses to these questions, I realized the importance of being able to explain complex processes in a way that anyone could understand.  A huge part of writing code is being able to clearly and concisely communicate the purpose of each line of code.  If I am able to write easily legible code, I should certainly be able to give a simple answer to any of these questions!

I have found that the two most important elements of a good explanation are brevity and use of an example.  A long, rambling response usually creates more confusion.  Thus far, everyone that has asked me about my course has simply wanted an overview of what I am learning.  Although it is also important to be able to explain each component of programming, there is no need to dive into the specifics when your audience just wants a broad understanding of what computer programming entails.  Unless further probed, my explanation goes something like this:

I am learning the skills needed to work as a web developer which means that I will be able to create and maintain websites and mobile applications.  Essentially, I am learning a variety of computer languages and how/when to use them.  These languages each have their own responsibility and they interact with one another to create an interactive website such as Facebook.  Consider the Facebook homepage: one language is used to produce the actual words on the page.  Another language is used to style the text, for example, dividing the page into the columns.  Another language is used to redirect you to a new page when you click a link.  Yet another language is used to store your personal data such as your username and password or your profile picture.  

If this response if not sufficient, I will continue:

Another way to look at computer programming is as a human that knows many different languages.  When someone says something to that person, he/she receives and processes the information in his/her brain and then reacts to that information based on his/her previous knowledge.  When spoken to about a subject that he/she does not know, the person will not be able to produce the desired response.  In other words, this person can only respond to subjects that he/she has stored in his/her brain.  Just like that person, a website can only react to requests that it recognizes.  On Facebook, you cannot tag a photo so that it links to someone's profile if that profile does not exist.  Building a website is like teaching a person specific skills so that they can react to specific situations.

So far, a version of these explanations have worked well for me but I am constantly amending them based on the reactions I get.  I am constantly working to trim down my code so that it is in it's most simple and concise form.  I am doing the same with my explanation of my Flatiron program.
